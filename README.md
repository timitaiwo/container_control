# Container Control Project

This is project that aims to mimic [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) in creating a controlled development environment.

## Implementation plan

Initially this would be written in python and is designed to work with podman but alternive tools such as docker can be used as well.

It's still very early day i.e v0.1.0
